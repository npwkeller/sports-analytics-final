STAT 1341 Sports Analytics Final Project

Sports Analytics (STAT 1341) Final Project at the University of Pittsburgh. Conducted research analyzing the 2016-2017 NHL season using a variety of different statistical methods for analysis. I chose this season because it was the second of back to back Stanley cups for the Pittsburgh Penguins and they were the first team to do accomplish that feat within the Salary Cap era.
